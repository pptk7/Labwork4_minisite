      The KOSEN Institute of King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang
      (KOSEN - KMITL) or the KOSEN Institute of KMITL is an educational
      institution established under the Human Resources Development Project in
      Engineering, Technology, and Innovation. The institute supports investment
      and enhances the capabilities of the industrial sector in the country and
      region. It was established according to the Cabinet resolution on December
      4, 2018, with the Office of the Basic Education Commission and the
      Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology being
      responsible for the project as proposed by the Ministry of Education.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Human Resources Development Project in Engineering, Technology, and
      Innovation aligns with the Thailand 4.0 policy, which supports investment
      and enhances the capabilities of the industrial sector in the country and
      region, especially in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). It also focuses
      on developing human resources in science, technology, and innovation with
      high knowledge and potential to play a key role in promoting targeted
      industries, both existing and future industries. Moreover, it is an
      essential part of driving the country with innovative and creative
      advancements. In addition to increasing the number of quality personnel in
      the group of practical engineers to meet demand, the project can also
      attract foreign companies, such as from Japan, to invest more in Thailand.
      Therefore, the Thai government has signed an agreement with the Japanese
      government under a Japanese government loan project that provides
      assistance and support in education and academics to achieve the set
      objectives.
    </p>

    <p>
      The KOSEN Institute of KMITL offers a 5-year engineering diploma program
      that combines theoretical knowledge with practical skills. The curriculum
      is designed to equip students with the necessary competencies to excel in
      various engineering fields, including mechanical, electrical, civil, and
      computer engineering. Students benefit from hands-on training, industry
      internships, and exposure to cutting-edge technologies, preparing them for
      successful careers in the engineering sector.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, to ensure that the academic operations of the KOSEN Institute of
      KMITL align with the objectives approved by the Cabinet, King Mongkut's
      Institute of Technology Ladkrabang has entered into a cooperation
      agreement with NIT (National Institute of Technology) Japan to develop the
      curriculum of the KOSEN Institute of KMITL to align with the MCC (Main
      Core Curriculum), which is the core curriculum of the KOSEN Institutes in
      Japan. To ensure that the teaching and learning of the KOSEN Institute of
      KMITL follow the set curriculum, NIT has sent expert faculty members to
      serve as models and to prepare and develop Thai faculty members to gain
      experience and expertise in mathematics, science, engineering, and
      technology according to the KOSEN model in Japan.
